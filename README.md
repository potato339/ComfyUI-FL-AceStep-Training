## 🚀 First Steps: How to Use the Training Nodes

Once installed, you can use the LoRA training nodes with ACE-Step 1.5 within ComfyUI by following these steps:

1. **Open ComfyUI** on your computer.

2. **Load the FL AceStep Training nodes.** These are special blocks you can add to your workflow. They help train models focused on music generation.

3. **Prepare your training data.** You will need audio files or music samples you want the AI to learn from. These should be in common formats like WAV or MP3.

4. **Add your files to the training node.** Point the node to your music files folder.

5. **Set training parameters.** You’ll see options like training duration or learning speed. If you are unsure, use the default settings to start.

6. **Start the training.** Click "Run" to let the AI learn from your music data. This may take some time depending on your computer.

7. **Save the trained model** when done. You can then use the model to generate music within ComfyUI or export it for other uses.
